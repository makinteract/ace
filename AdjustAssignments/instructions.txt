1. Download the committee bids ("as a spreadsheet" link) and rename to PCS-bids.csv.

3. Unzip file AdjustAssignments-210920c.zip to a directory

4. Put your file PCS-bids.csv into the AdjustAssignments folder

5. Run AdjustAssignments.pde from the AdjustAssignments folder

6. You should see a window with your ACs and your papers (similar to the video)

7. Whenever you drag a paper to a new AC, the system will create a file "temp-assignments.csv"

8. Pressing the 's' key will create a file "assignments.csv"

9. If you close the program and re-open later, it will read the assignments.csv file and use these for what is shown

10. The system will refuse to drag a paper to an AC who is already 1AC or 2AC for that paper

11. There are many usability issues (and likely many bugs) still in the program. Press 's' frequently to make sure you save your progress

12. If you have questions, contact me through the chairs' slack or at gutwin@cs.usask.ca
